# IPCMemoryExpansion

The project aims at creating a 7M RAM and 8M ROM memory expansion to the HP Integral compurter. RAM is implemented using a single SRAM chip and ROM is implemented usinga single NOR FLASH ROM chip. DIP-switches are used to map the ROM into the various ROM areas of the Integral.
